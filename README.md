When the platform is opened it shows a search bar and a map of Sofia, Bulgaria.
When you click anywhere on the map it catches your the location you clicked and gives you information about the PD serves that region.
Every PD region is colored in different colors so you can easily recognize it.
If you want to see which PD serves for specific street or adress just enter the adress in the search bar and the platform will give you the info.
If you enter an adress that is not in Sofia, the platform will give you an alert.
The platform is case insensitive but it works only on cyrillic.
